After creating a new wallet, you will be taken to the dashboard. You will need to click on the "Activate Wallet" button to enable the full functionality of the wallet.

To activate your account, you must deposit a small gas fee to your ETH address. Note that the address provided is functional even though the wallet is inactive. Remember that activation fees are required for users who want to use account abstraction wallets to prevent spam transactions and protect the network from potential attacks. These fees are paid in Ether and are used to ensure that only legitimate transactions are processed on the network.

The reason for this is that the NG4337 wallet is a smart contract wallet based on ERC-4337. On a blockchain network like Ethereum, there will be a network fee to deploy any contract. It is a one-time operation. After activation, you can then enjoy the convenience and security of ERC-4337 for transfers, contract interactions, etc.

Before clicking the "Activate Wallet" button,  you will need to deposit a small gas fee to your wallet. Otherwise, you will receive a pop-up box indicating that your balance is insufficient.

Then, in the confirmation page, click “Sign” button to submit activation request to the network. Within a few minutes, you will receive an success message.

Now you can use the full functionality of the NG4337 wallet. We recommend that you set up your wallet guardian in case you lose your access. You can also skip the step for now and set it up later in the settings.
