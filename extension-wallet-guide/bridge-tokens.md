# Bridge tokens

If you want to deposit your tokens from Ether (L1) to the zkSync era network (L2) or want to withdraw from L1 to L2, you can go to the asset details page and click on the bridge button. A window will pop up and will direct you to the zkSync bridge dApp page. You can then connect to the BlueWave wallet and make as many deposits or withdrawals as you like.
