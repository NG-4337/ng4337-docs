# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to 4337NG Wallet



{% hint style="info" %}
4337NG Wallet will be built on ERC4337, which was released on the Ethereum Mainnet recently, bringing account abstraction to the web3 ecosystem, which will lead to the massive adoption of web2 users. 4337NG wallet will initially support the Ethereum mainnet and the Zksync era network, with plans to expand to more EVM-compatible networks in the future.

## Advantages

Advantages of 4337NG Wallet compared with the traditional EOA wallet.

* Social Recovery: Users can designate a list of accounts authorized to access their funds or assist in wallet recovery. This feature eliminates concerns about key loss and enables multiple accounts to collaborate in retrieving funds in case of emergencies.
* Multisig Transactions: Transactions requiring approval from multiple users before execution.
* Batched Transactions: Users can bundle multiple actions into a single transaction, reducing fees and ensuring the sequential and atomic execution of actions.
* Custom Verification Logic: Smart contract wallets can implement custom methods for verifying user intent, utilizing simpler or quantum-resistant signatures.
* Atomic Operations: Simultaneous token transfers to different addresses in a single on-chain transaction. Uniswap can be utilized to combine approval and swapping actions, enabling multiple authorizations without security risks.
* Custom Security Features: Users can set varying permissions for different assets, such as higher thresholds for high-value assets like NFTs, requiring admin key management by a hardware wallet. This enhances security without sacrificing convenience.
* Offline Authorization: Users can sign offline authorizations for specific transactions, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without the need for third-party contract authorizations.
* Scheduled Payments: Configuring transactions to be executed at specific times.
* Paymaster Configuration: Implementing a paymaster to abstract gas payments and provide flexibility when paying ETH gas fees.
