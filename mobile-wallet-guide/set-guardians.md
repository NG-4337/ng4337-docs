# Set Guardians

Setting guardians means you can designate trusted individuals who can access your wallet in case of an emergency or if you become unable to access it yourself. This is a crucial step in protecting your assets and ensuring they are recovered and secured in case of unforeseen circumstances.

After you have activated your wallet, you will see a pop-up box. You can start setting up a guardian by clicking on "Set up a guardian". You can also access this process from Settings > Security > Set up a Guardian.
